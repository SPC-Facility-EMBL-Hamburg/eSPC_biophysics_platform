#Exercise 1: Basis set selection and its effects on CD predictions for Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha

#In this example we calculate and compare two CD spectra for our chosen protein using its crystal
#structure (1tnf.pdb) and two different basis spectrum sets, both based on the same secondary
#structure (SS) composition determined by the program DSSP.


#Step 1: prediction using the DSSP-T basis set 
#First we perform a normal CD prediction and compare it to the spectrum provided in this directory:

../../scripts/SESCA_main.py @pdb 1tnf.pdb   @ref CD_TNF.dat   @lib DSSP-T  @write CD_comp_DSSP-T.out
#     SESCA main module     structure file   spectrum file    basis set     output file

#The resulting main output file (CD_comp_DSSP-T.out) shows that the predicted spectrum differs from
#the reference spectrum by an RMSD of 3.0 kMRE, with an estimated 12.7+/-6.1 % error in the models
#SS composition.


#Step 2: prediction using the DSSP-1 basis set
#Note that, in step 1 we already calculated the SS-composition of TNF alpha using the SESCA_dssp
#module (summarized in Dssp_1tnf.out). This SS composition can be provided to SESCA directly using the
#@BB_file to skip the pre-processing step, as both DSSP-T and DSSP-1 basis sets are compatible with
#the DSSP structure classification protocol. The second CD prediction therefore can obtained with: 

../../scripts/SESCA_main.py @BB_file Dssp_1tnf.out  @ref CD_TNF.dat   @lib DSSP-1   @write CD_comp_DSSP-1.out
#     SESCA main module     SS summary file         spectrum file     basis set     output file

#The prediction in this case gives slightly different results with an RMSD of 2.9 kMRE, and a
#15.1 +/- 7.6 % SS error estimate. To showcase the results, the CD spectra calculated from the two
#basis sets were loaded into xmgrace (TNF_fit.agr) and transformed into an image file (TNF_fit.png).


#More on default basis sets:
#The predicted spectra in our examples differed because different basis spectrum sets combine the
#SS information differently into classes, for which the basis spectra were determined. The SESCA
#package includes several default basis sets contained in the 'libs' subdirectory, listed in and
#read from the 'libs/Basis_sets.nfo' file. This file contains information in six columns: 1 - the
#code by which the basis set can be called through SESCA_main (name), 2 - the underlying SS
#classification protocol (SS type), 3 - file name containing the backbone basis spectra
#(located in the libs subdir), 4 - file name containing the side chain contributions (or None if
#the basis set has no side chain parameters), 5 - this column indicates if the basis set has Error
#estimation parameters (Yes/No), and 6 - Comments for the basis set. Adding, deleting, or
#commenting out lines in Basis_sets.nfo allows users to quickly introduce or remove default basis
sets for SESCA.

#Note that the user can also specify basis set parameters manually: backbone and side chain basis
#set parameter files can be provided using the @BB_lib and @SC_lib flags respectively, whereas the
#required pre-processor can be specified with the @method flag. For example, one can manually
#specify to use the DSSP-F basis set the with following command:

../../scripts/SESCA_main.py @BB_file Dssp_1tnf.out  @ref CD_TNF.dat  @BB_lib ../../libs/Set_DSSP-F.dat @write CD_comp_DSSP-F.out
#     SESCA main module     SS summary file         spectrum file     basis set                          output file

#which yields a third predicted CD spectrum with RMSD of 2.7 kMRE, but no error estimate on the
#model since error calibration was not performed for this particular basis set. Note that since the
#SS composition was already determined for the protein, there was no need to specify the SS
#classification method.

#More on basis set files:
#Basis sets translate the structural information (mostly SS composition) into CD spectra. Basis set
#files contain up to four data blocks, of which two (the basis spectra and the assignment block)
#are mandatory for SESCA. As an example, the user can open the file Map_DSSP-T.dat from the libs
#subdirectory in a text editor. The first block in the basis set contains general information about
#the reference set which was used to derive the basis set (more details in exercise 3).
#The second block, called Assignment or combination matrix, defines how many SS classes are used
#(number of rows) in the basis sets and determines how SS elements from the pre-processor (columns)
#are assigned to each. For DSSP-T,  there are three SS classes (Helix, Sheet, and Coil) and eight
#SS elements as they appear in the SS summary obtained from the SESCA_dssp module. The matrix shows
#that the fraction of 3-,4-,5-Helix elements are assigned to the Helix class, the Beta-strand
#residues are assigned to the Sheet class, and all other fractions are added to Coil class,
#indicated by 1.000 values in the matrix.
#The third data block contains the basis spectra for each SS class, describing the normalized CD
#signal intensities at each wavelength by default in 1000 degree*cm^2/dmol (kMRE) units. During the
#CD calculation, the basis spectra are weighted by the fraction of amino acids assigned to their
#corresponding class in the structural model, and then summed to determine the theoretical CD
#spectrum. 
#The fourth data block of the basis set is an optional error calibration block. This block is derived
#from calibration curves fitted to synthetic data sets of CD spectra and SS compositions. The calib-
#ration curves contain the mean and standard deviation of model SS errors (dSSj) observed
#for given deviations (RMSDj) between the predicted and the measured CD spectrum. A calibration
#block for any basis set may contain several such curves, and chosen from using the @err flag.
#The default optimized basis sets of SESCA include four calibration curves. Curves 1 and 2 were
#derived using SS compositions randomly drawn from uniform SS composition, and curves 3 and 4
#were computed by synthetic data sets following the join probablity distribution of alpha-helices and 
#beta-sheets for globular proteins in the protein data bank (PDB) as obtained by the DSSP algorithm.
#In addition curves 1 and 3 were calculated without re-sclaing the measured CD spectra, and curves 
#2 and 4 were obtained by re-scaling them during the comparison to the predicted CD spectra.
