#Exercise 3: Deriving new basis spectra from reference data

#Basis spectra are essential parts of any SESCA basis set, that represent the average CD spectra
#of secondary structure classes. The predicted CD spectrum is the weighted sum basis spectra,
#where the coefficients are determined based on the presence of these classes in the model structure.
#During basis set derivation we reverse this process, and fit the basis spectra to the available
#reference CD spectra and reference coefficients through the equation:

# Sjl = Sum(Cji * Bil)

#where Sjl is the CD intensity of protein j at wavelength l, Cji is the fraction of amino acids
#assigned to class i in the structure of protein j and Bil is the CD intensity of basis spectrum i
#at wavelength l. The coefficients Cji are obtained from a secondary structure (SS) classification
#algorithm with k SS elements. The SS elements (Wjk) of protein j  are assigned to the SS classes
#using the a combination matrix with elements Aki:

# Cji = Sum(Wjk * Aki)

#Step 1: derive basis spectra
#The equation system for N reference proteins is solved using the script Basis_solver_3.py from the
#SESCA/scripts subdirectory. This script takes 3 input files in this order: a spectrum file list,
#an SS data file list, and combination matrix. For this exercise the necessary input files were
#already collected in the subdirectory EV9_data, and file lists pointing to the files were prepared.
#calling the script like:

../../scripts/SESCA_solver.py   spectrum_files.inp    Dssp_files.inp       BS_test.map
#   basis solver script            CD file list         SS data file list    combination matrix

#Note that combination matrix in this case contains only 1.0 and 0.0 values, and only one 1.0 value
#is present in every column, resulting in a normalized non-overlapping assignment of the SS elements.
#While this is not a strict requirement of the CD spectrum predictions, it allows for a more clear
#and straightforward interpretation of the basis spectra. Note that to extract a meaningful basis 
#set the number of reference proteins should be larger (ideally more than twice) than the number of 
#basis spectra to be extracted. By default, SESCA_solver also prints a summary file (Matrices.dat),
#which contains all spectra (Sjl), SS fractions (Wjk), and Coefficients (Cji) used in the basis set
#extraction.


#Step 2: using the new basis set
# The created basis set (written to Basis spectra.dat)  can used directly with other SESCA modules,
#for instance the CD spectrum of papain can be estimated and compared to measured spectra by:

../../scripts/SESCA_pred.py @tar EV9_data/Dssp_papn.out @lib Basis_spectra.dat @ref EV9_data/CD_PAPN.out
# CD prediction module         SS data file                basis set file       reference spectrum
