Added:
2013.09.26

Bugfixes for DISICL_prep.py, DISICL_dihed.py and DISICL_dbssp.py
(after testing out custom library options)

New module: DISICL_main.py (automated protocol to do the whole analysis)
DISICL_main.py should be able guess all information based on library and input file information.
User can still specify parameters with optional command flags, including residue ranges and time steps.
DISICL_main can function in trajectory and in database mode to execute classification with different
libraries sequentially.
It can also execute custom classifications if it is provided with required
classification library and residue names.

Library update: all default DISICL libraries received new names and labels matching the publications
Additionally the XI angle was renamed to ZET to match IUPAC naming convention.
Irreg. Beta structures received new label (IRB) to avoid identical labeling with the Irreg. B nucleotide class (IB)

2013.10.25

Fixed: timestep synchronization problem when using the @stride option with DISICL_main

Added a brief installation instruction file (INSTALL.txt) and comments to the places to be edited

2013.12.18
Update: usage text updated for DISICL_prep.py, DISICL_dihed.py, DISICL_dbssp.py and DISICL_main.py
No changes in the algorithms themselves.

2014.01.16
New module: DISICL_vis.py (script for visualization in PyMol)
DISICL_vis can prepare PyMol sessions and .png images from refined .pdb files and classification results.
The module is also incorporated into DISICL_main.py and can be started via the @vis command.

Library update: All standard classification libraries were updates with their color schemes for DISICL_vis.py
All coloring schemes are marked with the @col flag

2014.01.27

Version 1.0 is released under the GNU Public License 3.0 (See license.txt)

Fixed: DISICL_main error on DISICL_vis @type flag

Minor graphical imporvements on DISICL_vis module
