Installation Instructtions for DISICL - DIhedral based Segment Identification and CLassification

Requirements: DISICL requires an operating pyhton (2.7 or 3.0) which is running on your operating system.

DISICL was tested on Linux (Ubuntu 12.4 and 12.10 series), Unix and Windows 7 ans 10 systems. 

How to install:
	- Unpack the compressed DISICL package into  a directory of your choice
          (for example: /home/nagnaat/programs/self/)
        
	- Open DISICL_main.py within the DISICL directory ( you can use vi, winword or other text editors). 

	- Set the variable win (line 71) to 1 if you run DISICL on Windows (set it to 0 if you are installing on linux)

	- Set the variable main (line 75), it should be equal to the absolute path of your DISICL directory
	  (for example: main = "/home/nagnaat/programs/self/DISICL")

	- Set the location of the library Directory only if you change it

	- Save and close DISICL_main.py

	- Open DISICL_prep.py

	- Set the variable win (line 40) to 1 if you run DISICL on Windows (set it to 0 if you are installing on linux) 
 	
	- Save and close DISICL_prep.py

	- If you are running DISICL on Linux, give permission to execute for all python files in your DISICL directory
	  (for example: chmod +rwx *.py) 

Optional:
	- You can define aliases for DISICL_main.py and the modules for easier usage (in linux, use .bashrc or .profile)
	  (for example: alias DISICL_main="/home/nagnaat/programs/self/DISICL/DISICL_main.py")

	- Source your modified .bashrc or .profile to enable the new alias
	
	- Under Windows you can use the command prompt to run DISICL, to define an alias there you have to start the prompt
	  with a command as a target.

	- Create a comand file (any text editor, example C:\Mycommands.cmd)

	- You can define new system commands in this file with the DOSKEY
	  (for example DOSKEY DISICL_main = "C:\programs\self\DISICL\DISICL_main.py" $*) 

	- Create a shortcut on your desktop, your target for the prompt should be "c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /K C:\Mycommands.cmd"

	- Alternatively you can also write the DOSKEY command in the prompt directly, but it is lost upon closing the prompt

Program usage is provided for each module independently. call the program without arguments to view them.
