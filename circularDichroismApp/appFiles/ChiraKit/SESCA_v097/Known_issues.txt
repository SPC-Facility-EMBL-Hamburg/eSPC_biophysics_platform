#Known issues in the current version:

- DISICL "ENDMDL" bug:
description:	
DISICL_prep.py preprocessor fails to determine residue information, properly, when there are two
lines starting with "END"/"ENDMDL" at the end of the file, with no structural model between the.
This also causes SESCA to fail, since no SS information is determined.

solution: 
the prep module reads in residue information from the last frame, this problem will be corrected when
DISICL is rewritten as a set of Python modules. Until then, users are ecouraged to either delete or 
comment out (with a "#") the last END or ENDMDL. 

Note: the recent update on DISICL to provide Pthon 3 compatibility should solve this issue, but if a 
similar error occurs again, please notify the authors!

- DISICL parallelization request:
description:
Currently the DISICL code is not parallelized, and this makes dihedral angle calculations for large 
ensembles quite slow (up to several minutes).
solution:
Since it is a rate limiting step, rewriting the DISICL dihed module with a parallel code would speed
up the algorithm significantly. Parallelization of the code is planned in future releases, along with
the DISICL code update to make DISICL scripzd fully functional Python modules.



- SESCA_seq source directory bug:
description:
when the pdb file is provided in a different directory using a relative path, it causes a bug in the
SESCA_seq module.

solution:
Check and fix bug in the next release. Naming conventions should only use the file name but not the path.

Note: This bug was addressed and fixed. Should a similar problem occur, please notify the Authors!
