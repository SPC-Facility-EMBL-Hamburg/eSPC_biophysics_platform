## General description

The eSPC webserver is currently hosted through ShinyProxy, with each tool contained in a docker image. To modify an existing app, you need to have proficiency in Python and R. 

## If you want to try the tools but don't plan to edit the code

1) Install docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

```
sudo bash updateDocker.bash
``` 
 
## To install individual tools (for developers)

Follow the README.md document:

| Tool                  | Path                                    |
| :---                  |     :---                                |
| MoltenProt            | foldA_moltenP_apps/README.md            |
| FoldAffinity          | foldA_moltenP_apps/README.md            |
| ThermoAffinity        | thermoA_app/README.md                   |
| PhotoMol              | refeynApp/README.md                     | 
| Raynals               | dynamicLightScatteringApp/README.md     | 
| ChiraKit              | circularDichroismApp/README.md          | 

## Installation of the whole eSPC platform 

Minimum requirements: R version 4.2.2 and Python version 3

To install the eSPC platform in the development machine, follow this instructions:

1) Clone or download this repo
2) Install docker       (tested with Docker version 23.0.1, https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
3) Install java         (tested with openjdk 11.0.18)
4) Install shinyproxy   (tested with shinyproxy3.0, https://www.shinyproxy.io/downloads/)
5) Create the file '/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf' and fill it with the following text:

    [Service]  
    ExecStart=  
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H unix:// -D -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375  

This file will be used for setting up the Docker systemd service

6) Modify the file paths shown in application.yml according to your machine
7) Start the docker service
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start docker
```
8) Build the docker images
```
sudo bash updateDocker.bash
```

9) To test the correct installation run shinyproxy
```
java -jar shinyproxy-x.y.z.jar
```    
10) Open localhost:8080 inside any browser

Additionally, you can enter and inspect each of the docker images by running

```
docker run -t -i docker_container_name /bin/bash
```  

## General code structure
