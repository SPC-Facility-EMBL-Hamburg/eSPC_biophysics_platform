# The eSPC platform 

Last time updated: April 2025

## Introduction

The eSPC platform (spc.embl-hamburg.de) is a collection of programs designed to analyze biophysical data using different techniques. The table below shows the tools available along with their purpose:

| Tool 					| Purpose 											| Technique |
| :---         			|     :---:      									|          ---: |
| MoltenProt   			| Protein stability     							| Differential scanning fluorimetry    |
| FoldAffinity     		| Binding affinity       							| Differential scanning fluorimetry      |
| ThermoAffinity     	| Binding affinity      						 	| Microscale thermophoresis / fluorescence quenching      |
| PhotoMol     			| Sample size, oligomerization and homogeneity		| Mass photometry      |
| Raynals     			| Sample size and homogeneity       				| Single-angle dynamic light scattering      |
| ChiraKit     			| Protein stability, secondary structure, binding   | Circular dichroism      |
